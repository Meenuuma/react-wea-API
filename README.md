Building a Real-Time Weather App with React, API, Tailwind CSS, and useEffect 🌦️
I’m excited to share my latest project: a Weather App that fetches real-time weather data using an API! 🚀
🔹 Technologies used:
	• React: For building the user interface and handling state.
	• Tailwind CSS: To create a sleek, responsive, and beautiful design.
	• useEffect: To handle API calls and manage the component lifecycle.
	• Weather API: Fetching live weather information.
With this app, users can:
	• View the current weather for any city.
	• Check key weather metrics (temperature, humidity, wind speed).
	• Get real-time updates by connecting to an external weather API.
📱 Key Features:
	• A clean and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.
	• Fetching data dynamically with React’s useEffect hook.
	• Fetching real-time weather data from the Weather API.
